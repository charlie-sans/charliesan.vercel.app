description: i forgot i had this
---


it's been a bit since i have touched this place and i thought i might return and hopefully setup a reminder that could actualy keep reminding me that this place existed.


i've reciently gotten a MacBook Pro and have been playing around with MacOS montery and ventura.
i think MacOS does have a good look but the fact that it's got that weird like, music player just kinda makes it weird.

it's got that whole futureistic look to it but at the same time, i quiote don't want to get hit with a brick.


i booted into linux for the first time this month since 2 months ago. shocking i know.
and i got a new desktop enviroment called fvwm. it looks like it game out of a read hat linux 4.2 install or from gnome 1.X like enviroment. 

it's really fast and i do quite like it, might even keep it on my system and remove kde and gnome.

though i know people are going to have a fit about it at somepoint.
