So for a while I've been wanting to create a personal website for myself because of the idea that not having one might not allow me to get noticed.

now that i have one. i can finally release updates on personal projects with you all about things. or really, things that i want to get to.


i want to attempt to fill this out with current information that I'm doing or projects that I'm working on.

whether it's something small as a simple codebase refractor, or something as big as Kode-runner version 2.2 { more on that later }.
