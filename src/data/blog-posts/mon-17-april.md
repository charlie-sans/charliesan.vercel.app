so apparently, you can have too wide of a character in C++.

Micro-Assembly is coming along great right now. 
implemented some new features such as color in the terminal for the MASM C++ runtime,
a decompiler for the bytecode that doesn't quite give perfict results but i guess that's what it's suppost to be, and some other things like forcing certain things with cmd line arguments and things.

it's hektic but you should check it out at [on the github](https://github.com/fy-nite/C-Masm).



i did other things too but i can't for the life of me remember them.
