so i'm outside with my mac for the first time in a bit and it's kinda nice to get fresh air.
it's been sort of raining for the past 5 minutes but i've been undercover away from the rain so it's been nice.

no, the mac hasn't gotten wet.. *yet*

though, i'm still thinking of things to do for C-Masm.
i got the magic bytecode header working again, somehow the struct wasn't getting packed or "initialised" when it was being written.
