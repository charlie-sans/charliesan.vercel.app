well, i finally finished working on the first and like many list of beta releases for Uhigh, a custom programming language that compiles to different languages.
you can check it out [here](https://github.com/Fy-nite/uhigh.net).
the first release is a bit messy, but it works and compiles to C#.

the later releases have support for more languages, like vala, javascript, cpp, and a few more languages which i never got around to making backeds for.


better yet, it's been 3 months since i wrote the first part of this document.
